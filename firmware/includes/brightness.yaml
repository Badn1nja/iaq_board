                            This code is setting the brightness of all 3 LEDs when the Ambient light sensor
                            is updated. The LEDs are very bright so their brightness is limited to 50% on 1000 lux.
                            Brightness regulates from 11% to 50%+correction from 2 to 1000 lux linear.
                            These LEDs turn off if brightness is 10% or lower, 11% is the weakest on setting.
                            There is correction option of up to 40% for weaker LEDs and limit increases also with
                            the same amount of correction value. For very bright conditions intensity goes to 100%.
