This folder contains [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/) project in [iaq_device folder](iaq_device) - schematic, [datasheets](iaq_device/datasheets) and [gerber](iaq_device/plot) files.

In order to print the PCB you have to zip all files from plot folder, these are the gerber files. Then upload the zip like [explained here](https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/21-how-do-i-place-an-order) for JLCPCB.

In the folder [my_libs](my_libs) are the custom footprint and symbol libraries, 3D models for kicad 3D viewer.
