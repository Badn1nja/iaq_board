# Ordering

I got some emails from people interested in buying the device, and here are the details in the bellow table. Please note that I do not make this device for mass production and the bellow prices are considered fair for the efforts I need to invest in organizing ordering and building the devices. If you build it yourself it will cost about half these prices with most of the parts from China stores like Aliexpress. 

Item | Price (EUR) | Notes 
:-----------------: | :-------------: | :------------- |
[PCB only](#PCB-only) | 5 | You have to order and solder all components yourself.
[Fully assembled PCB without sensors, but including the ambient light senor](#Assembled-PCB) | 35 | with high quality Samtec receptacles and Omron switches. You have to order all the other components yourself and solder the MH-Z19 sensor on the PCB.
[Fully assembled PCB with everything except SGP30 VOC sensor](#Fully-assembled-excluding-3D-printed-holder) | 92 | I rarely use this sensor, that's why adding this option.
[Fully assembled PCB with everything excluding case holder](#Fully-assembled-excluding-3D-printed-holder) | 100 | This option is without the case holder
[Fully assembled PCB incl. everything + holder](#Fully-assembled-device-with-holder) | 105 | this is the complete device
[Case holder, PETG material](#Case-holder)  | 7 | color can be red, blue, orange or black

***These prices exclude shipping. If you are interested in ordering, please send me an email to nkitanov@gmail.com with your address and I will let you know when the device can be ready as I might not have available parts and needs to order first.***
